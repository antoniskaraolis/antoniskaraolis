# Hello there! 👋

I'm Antonis, a Junior Data Analyst at a forex company and a passionate problem solver. I'm currently advancing my skills with an MSc in Applied Data Science and AI, but my educational background roots back to Mathematics and Economics. 

## 🧰 My Toolbox
Here's a list of tools and languages I often use:

- **Data Analysis & Wrangling:** Python (Pandas, NumPy), PostgreSQL, MySQL
- **Machine Learning & AI:** Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras
- **Data Visualization:** Tableau, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Big Data Technologies:** Google BigQuery
- **Version Control:** GitHub

## 🎯 Current Goals
- Master the art of data visualization using Tableau and Python. I am fascinated by the ability to tell a story through data and make complex information understandable.
- Become proficient in SQL. Understanding and manipulating databases is a crucial skill for any data analyst and I am committed to mastering it.
- Deepen my understanding of Machine Learning and AI techniques.
- Build a portfolio of data science projects on my GitHub.

## 📊 My Latest Projects

- **Stock Price Forecasting:** Utilized the ARIMA model to predict future stock prices, demonstrating proficiency in time series analysis and financial data interpretation.
- **Spam Classification:** Implemented a machine learning model to classify and filter out spam emails. Used techniques such as natural language processing, feature extraction, and model training and validation to achieve high accuracy.
- **Forex Market Analysis:** A project where I applied predictive models to forex data for price trend forecasting.
